## Project Requirements


### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 

 My portfolio includes two pages, a home page and a project page which includes separate boxes with details of projects. I have included a circular profile pict ure on the home page using image cropper which is aligned in the same row as the text aside from when it is in mobile view, in which case it appears as a column with the picture appearing above the text.  I have included a biography of 100 words detailing my current journey as part of the She Codes Plus bootcamp. 
 
 I opted for a neutral colour for the background and have included a functional contact form with fields for name, email and message. The submit button for the contact form appears blue when hovered over. The navigation bar on both sites appears in a row and is in bold, black text and links between the main page and the projects page. I also included links to external sites, including GitHub and LinkedIn. 
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from?

 There are two pages, including a home page and projects page and it is version controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub (yhxcodes.github.io). Both pages use semantic HTML in their structure. I included media queries for the home page to implement responsive design principles, for instance the circle profile picture inside the .image.cropper is set to different sizes based on screen width. Flexbox has been used on both pages, for instance for the section containing the profile picture and bio which is set to stack vertifically on smallr screens and horizontally on wider screens. The project page is made responsive using flexbox for the project containers and the project containers display information about each project and are designed to wrap and stack on smaller screens while remaining horizontally on larger screens.

### Bonus (optional)

I have included a hover effect changing the background colour of the button for the contact form when hovered. This transitions to a light blue when hovered over.
